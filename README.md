# TWO-PASS-ASSEMBLER

Designed an Instruction Set Architecture for 32bit machine that can handle C program.This include 

1. Introduction (reference to the C program, extraction of instructions, operands, any other
  information which is required to design the ISA).
  
2. Memory model

3. Registers

4. Instruction design

5. Instruction format

6. Data types

7. Addressing modes

8. Instruction types

9. Flow of control handling

C program which converts any given mnemonic code (as defined in the above ISA) to its equivalent binary machine code.

C program to implement the designed ISA as a computing machine which takes binary machine instructions as an input and produces the final output.

 Display status of registers, ALU control signals and flag register for each instruction execution.
